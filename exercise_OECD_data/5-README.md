# 5-Readme		

Main changes and updates to this code.

- We now use Agricultural Census 2017 instead of 2007 and 2002. "MARKET VALUE OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS  SOLD" by state (1000 $). 
- We now use Fish reports for 2015-2018: Table: U.S domestic landings, by region and by state.
- Regression coefficients (code 1) for service and agriculture gravity systems were updated.
