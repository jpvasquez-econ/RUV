# 1-Readme		

Main changes and updates to this code.

- Trade flows between countries changed from WIOD to ICIO-OECD 2015-2018. Download link can be found at the end of this file. These tables have extra countries, which we add to the existent Rest of World, RoW, category. Sectors crosswalk was updated (same 14 final sectors). China and Mexico are split into two parts in ICIO tables; we just add them up to have one China and one Mexico (see ICIO Readme); we haven't found if WIOD included export processing activities for China case. Finally, we applied the same WIOD fix to avoid negative trade flows in ICIO tables, even though the only negatives in these ones are in TAX-SUB and change in inventories, not trade flows per se. 
- US county population by state was updated to reflect 2018. See: [County Population Totals: 2010-2019 (census.gov)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html#par_textimage_70769902)

Dear ICIO and TiVA users,

Due to unforeseen and persistent technical problems, the links from the [ICIO web page](http://oe.cd/icio) are not functioning.

To access and download the ICIO tables in CSV, XLS or R format:

\-     go to the “harmonised national Input-Output Tables” OECD.STAT cube: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=IOTS_2021

\-     At the top of the page click on “Export”

\-     Choose “Related files”.  Here you should find five zipped files for each format.

We hope this helps.

Many apologies for any inconvenience caused.

Best regards,

The OECD ICIO/TiVA team
