# 2-Readme		

Main changes and updates to this code.

- Census data on state exports and imports start in 2002 and 2008 respectively. Since now we focus on 2015-2018, we do not have to make assumptions regarding years prior to starting points. We still make this data sum up to US-ICIO (proportionality).
